                                <p>I had a bit of an issue setting up, but called support and they had me up and running by the end of the call. It was more an error on my part than anything else. I haven't had and call quality issues and the price is good. I've only been using it for a month, so i'll update my review in a few months if I have any issues. So far so good and I would recommend them.</p>

                                <p>I recommend Nextiva highly. I run a small auto body shop and was using an old traditional phone system which was costing me a lot each moth. I started researching VoIP solutions and came across nextiva on this site and gave them a call. They were really professional and hooked me up with a great deal on a hosted phone system as well as the phones. I have been using it now for a few months and the quality is great and I've had no issues - plus, I'm saving about $300 a month! love these guys!</p>

                            <p>VoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, is a new form of digital IP telephone service in which calls are sent and received over the Internet. To utilize Voice over IP phone systems, all users need is a high speed Internet connection and a VoIP service provider.</p>
                            <p>VoIP service providers offer many highly advanced, next generation calling and conferencing features. Often these features are included, and can be real valuable assets every step of the way throughout your specific communication needs. Traditionally, many of the calling features now included with VoIP phone services were exercised by a human being operating a switchboard. Directing call traffic appropriately is vital to the success of any business. With voice over IP solutions, many of them are customizable to put your business at the pinnacle of efficiency and professionalism. Network features are designed to make sure your business never misses a beat – keeping your infrastructure at the tip of your fingers at all times.</p>
